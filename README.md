Create Code Signing Certificate on Windows for PS scripts

## Windows 7
__New-SelfSignedCertificateEx__ Self-signed certificate generator (PowerShell script)
https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/self-signed-certificate-5920a7c6
```
New-SelfsignedCertificateEx -Subject "CN=Test Code Signing" `
-EKU "Code Signing" `
-KeySpec "Signature" ` 
-KeyUsage "DigitalSignature" `
-FriendlyName "Test code signing"
-NotAfter $([datetime]::now.AddYears(5))
```

## Windows 8
__certreq.exe__ built-in
```
Certreq â€“new path\inffilename.inf
```

inffilename.inf:
```
[NewRequest]
Subject = "CN=Test Code Signing"
KeyLength = 2048
KeyAlgorithm = RSA
ProviderName = "Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"
MachineKeySet = false
Exportable = true
KeySpec = 2
KeyUsage = 0x80
RequestType = Cert
[EnhancedKeyUsageExtension]
OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 ; Code signing
```

## Windows 10
__New-SelfSignedCertificate__ PowerShell cmdlet
```
New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation cert:\currentuser\my `
-Subject "CN=Test Code Signing" `
-KeyAlgorithm RSA `
-KeyLength 2048 `
-Provider "Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider" `
-KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
-KeyUsage DigitalSignature `
-Type CodeSigningCert
```

## Alternative
__CreateCertGUI__

## Util
Dir code signing certificates
```
gci cert: -rec -code
```

Sign script
```
Set-AuthenticodeSignature script.ps1 @(Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\CurrentUser\My -CodeSigningCert)
```

## Comments
However, self-signed certificate usage for code signing in production environments is dsicouraged. You should use them in test environments only.

For private usage (within organization only), you should check if company already owns PKI infrastructure and contact appropriate personnel to receive company-approved code signing certificate.

For public scripts (you are going to distribute along with software packages, or deliver scripts to your customers), I would suggest to purchase code signing from globally trusted commercial CA provider.
